# Statistics
There are several essential statistical quantities which play a crucial role in astrophysics and cosmology. In this repository, I'm trying to write them in python codes. In this way, not only other researchers can use them, but also make them easier to understand and visualization.

You can find my notes in 'codes' folder.
